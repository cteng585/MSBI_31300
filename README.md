# Final Project

### Description
---
#### 1. Describes the project. If you are doing a predefined project choice, explain how you implemented that specific choice. This description should match what you submitted as your project proposal. (4 points)
Project idea: Scrape skills related to a specific job interest, and train a language 
model to recognize those skills and identify them in a resume context. Then generate
a prompt to be submitted to GPT-3 or ChatGPT to have those language models create a
cover letter.
---
#### 2. Explains in a few sentences why you selected this project, and if you learned what you had hoped to learn by doing this project (from your proposal). Explain. (4 points)
Interest: Natural Language Processing is an incredibly versatile tool thatâ€™s used for 
everything from ordinary text parsing to categorizing functional genomic regions in gene 
sequence data. The flexibility and utility of NLP is something that I want to learn to 
utilize, and using it to generate a relatively standardized text output. 
What I learned: I gained familiarity with the data types/formats that are commonly 
used in the NLP space. Learned how to use spaCy and NLTK Python libraries. I also became
more familiar with common complications in the space of generating testing/training
data.

#### 3. What you would do differently if you were to have an opportunity to redo this project and why. (4 points)
Instead of designing my own training loop, I probably would've taken advantage of the
config based training that spaCy v3.0 suggests using now. I used the old method because
I wanted to gain additional familiarity with OOP and also see how the industry standard of
OOP appears to 3rd party developers. 
I would also create a much more robust training set. Currently, the "trained" model is very
bad at distinguishing the barriers between skills. For example, if there is a list of skills in
the resume separated by bullet points, spaCy tries to interpret the entire bulleted list as a
single entity.

#### 4. How to run your project. (4 points)
- Step 0: install java 7 or 7+ runtime for tika if java isn't already installed (try `java --version`) (one of the dependencies) [instructions here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jdk.html)
- Step 1: install poetry if not already on system (follow the instructions here: [poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- Step 2: initialize a `pyproject.toml` file with `poetry init`
- Step 3: install dependencies with `poetry install`

Please see the `--help` option for `main.py` for detailed instructions on use (including use of LinkedIn scraper). 
*Following steps will be basic usage steps using the pre-generated skills file* 
- Step 4: parse resume and generate autogenerated prompt
`python main.py [PATH_TO_RESUME] [COMPANY_TO_SUBMIT_TO] [ROLE_OF_RECIPIENT] --job-query [PHRASE_RELATED_TO_JOB] --job-query[PHRASE_RELATED_TO_JOB]`

#### 5. Was the project challenging in the way you expected? What did you overcome? (4 points)
Project was incredibly challenging. Some of the problems I encountered were:
- Getting a skills data set. Initial idea was to use LinkedIn API but investment needed was too high. Eventually decided to combine scraping LinkedIn with using JobZilla's JSONL
- Populating an appropriate training data set. Using an idea from the blog on NER, I used sentence templates which I filled with scraped skills
- Parsing a PDF into a Python string. Tried multiple different non-standard library solutions until I discovered Tika which is easy to start up and implement.

#### 6. Cited sources, appropriate acknowledgements. Explain how each source applied to your project. (5 points)
- [spaCy Documentation](https://spacy.io/): Helped me figure out how to build and train a NLP model. Special interest given to Language Processing Pipelines page for telling me what each component of the spaCy model did.
- [Blog on Named Entity Recognition](https://ner.pythonhumanities.com/03_02_train_spacy_ner_model.html): Helped me understand the concept of Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- [Blog on Catastrophic Forgetting](https://explosion.ai/blog/pseudo-rehearsal-catastrophic-forgetting): Blog detailing the catastrophic forgetting problem and how the solution is easier than one might think
- [Blog on Selenium and Scraping LinkedIn](https://medium.com/featurepreneur/how-to-build-a-web-scraper-for-linkedin-using-selenium-and-beautifulsoup-94ab717d69a0): Blog that got me started on using Selenium. I did not end up using BeautifulSoup

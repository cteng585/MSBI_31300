# Final Project

### Description
---
Project idea: Scrape skills related to a specific job interest, and train a language 
model to recognize those skills and identify them in a resume context.

Interest: Natural Language Processing is an incredibly versatile tool thatâ€™s used for 
everything from ordinary text parsing to categorizing functional genomic regions in gene 
sequence data. The flexibility and utility of NLP is something that I want to learn to 
utilize, and using it to generate a relatively standardized text output.

What I hope to learn: Gain familiarity with the data types/formats that are commonly 
used in the NLP space. Learn how to use spaCy and NLTK Python libraries. Become 
more fluent in interacting with APIs.
